Hey there! I'm Geethna, a cybersecurity enthusiast and problem solver with a knack for unraveling digital mysteries. With a background in Android Reverse Engineering and System Security, I've dived headfirst into into Penetration Testing and vulnerability analysis, armed with a degree in Computer Engineering.

When I'm not tinkering with code or brushing up on the latest security trends, you can find me jamming on my guitar or piano, hanging out with my furry friend, or exploring the great outdoors. I'm a travel junkie too, always on the lookout for new places around the globe ðŸš€âœ¨
