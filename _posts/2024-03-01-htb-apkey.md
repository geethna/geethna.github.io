So after a long time I decided to get back into blogging. Writing hasn't been my first nature so I kept on pushing the task of writeups or documenting my learning journey. 

This is going to be a writeup of a Hack the Box challenge from the Mobile category - APKey. I solved this challenge a couple of months back, and it was an easy challenge. 

## Static Analysis

As usual, I fired up jadx-gui to get an idea about the source code and mainly `android_manifext.xml`. 

There was nothing much in the manifest file, also looks like a little bit of obfuscation was done as we can see the class names being renamed. Next I went right to the main activitiy - `com.example.apkey.MainActivity`. 


```java
    public void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
        super.onCreate(bundle);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        this.f927b = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);
        this.f928c = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editTextTextPersonName);
        this.d = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editTextTextPassword);
        this.f927b.setOnClickListener(new a());
        }
```

From this it can be understood that there are 2 text fields - one for PersonName (or username) and then for password and a button. This is mostly a login functionality with the credential check.

Now let's look at working of the Mainactivity.

It can be seen that in the if condition, the username `f928c` string value is compared with the string `"admin"`. 
If this condition is true, the following happens : 

- The string value inside password is copied to to obj and an MD5 hash is done on it. 
- This value is matched with `"a2a3d412e92d896134d9c9126d756f"` and if this results to true, the content of maketest is displayed as a short duration notification. 

If the condition fails, it exists the previous if and displayed "Wrong Credentials" as notification in the application context. 

### Method 1

The first method I thought was to use an online md5 hash decrypter. But as anticipated, it did not work. 

### Method 2 - Patching

I first tried to reverse the function which generated the flag, that is, to reverse the functions being called : `makeText = Toast.makeText(applicationContext, b.a(g.a()), 1);`

After a couple of minutes, I understood that there should be another way to do this. 

Either get the value using dynamic analysis or patching. As I was not adept at using frida hooking, thought the best way to proceed was to patch the hash to a known value.  

I opened the `MainActivity$a.smali` in an editor and searched for the hash value. 

The changed it to the md5 hash of a dummy string - `"admin"` - `21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3`  and saved it. 

Now we have to recompile, sign and then run the apk and hopefully that will display the flag. 

To compile, I used this command - `apktool b APKey -o newapk.apk`

To sign the apk, I found a bunch of tools after reading online :

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release1.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release1.keystore newapk1.apk alias_name
```

These worked for me and then I uninstalled the old apk and installed the patched one.

```
adb uninstall "com.example.apkey"
adb install newapk.apk
```

### Getting the flag

Open the apk and enter the credentials `admin` : `admin` and the flag is displayed.

I learnt patching and the use of keytool and jarsigner to sign the apk and hence this was very interesting for me.
