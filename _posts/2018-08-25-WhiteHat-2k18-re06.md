WhiteHat came just after the Hackon CTF. I did not try the challenge during the CTF.

But then the challenge was quite decent. It was a `.net` binary.

### About the binary:

The binary was `.net` so I decided to use `ILSpy` to disassemble it. It was written in `C#`.

The disassembled code was very clear and easy to debug. It looks like this: ![alt text](assets/lib/ilspy1.png "ilspy1")

The input string was first Encrypted using the function `Enc` and then finally encoded using `base64`.

The function `Enc` was taking each letter from the string, converting it to its corresponding ascii value. Then comes the role of a simple straightforward `RSA` in it.

The `Enc` function:

![alt text](assets/lib/ilspy2.png "ilspy2")

`n` was given , `e` was given encrypted text was also given. There can be different approaches from this point. My approach was a simple one. The life-saver… Brute-force.

I decoded the `base64` and then took each char from that.

I took each printable character and encoded with the `Enc` function and checked with the above b64 decoded char.

If it matched, append it to the flag.

And that’s it. You got your flag.

Python code:

```python
import base64
string='iB6WcuCG3nq+fZkoGgneegMtA5SRRL9yH0vUeN56FgbikZFE1HhTM9R4tZPghhYGFgbUeHB4tEKRRNR4Ymu0OwljQwmRRNR4jWBweOKRRyCRRAljLGQ='
dec=base64.b64decode(string).decode('UTF-16LE')
new=''
import string
l='!@_{}'
chars=string.letters+ string.digits+l
def encode(s,e,n):
    array=[]
    while(e!=0):
        array.append(e%2)
        e/=2
    num2=1
    for i in range(len(array)-1,-1,-1):
        num2=num2*num2%n
        if(array[i]==1):
            num2=num2*ord(s)%n
    return num2
flag=''
for i in dec:
    for j in chars:
        var=encode(j,9157,41117)
        if(var==ord(i)):
            flag+=j
print flag
```

**Flag:**

`WhiteHat{N3xT_t1m3_I_wi11_Us3_l4rg3_nUmb3r}`
