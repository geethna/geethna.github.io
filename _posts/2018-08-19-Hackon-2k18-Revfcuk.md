The challenge was pretty easy. It had some conditions to bypass to get to the actual flag checking.

### About the binary:

I first opened the binary in IDA and saw that there were 5 conditions to bypass and then only we can go to the flag checking process.

### Patching and bypassing:

Opening the binary gdb will give you an idea about the anti-debugging techniques to bypass.

The first check happens inside `popen` function at the address: `0x40b904`

There a test happens, set the `eax` reg to `0`. The first check is bypassed.

Second one happens inside `fopen` function at the address: `0x40aee0`

Set the `esi` reg to `0`. Second is also bypassed.

Third happens at `0x4018a4` , set the `eax` reg to `0` to bypass it.

Fourth happens at `0x4018bb`, the same procedure as the third.

To bypass the fifth one open the binary in r2 in write mode and seek to the address 0x40195e and change the opcode of `jle` to `jg`.

Thatâ€™s it you have bypassed all the checks. Now going to the flag checking.

### Flag checking:

From IDA we can draw the following conclusion:

The length of the flag is `80`.

The input is taken `4` at a time and then hashed two times and is checked with another hash inside the binary. This continues for `20` times.
You can get the hashes inside the program can be found by setting a breakpoint at the address `0x401acd`. Pretty simple right! The `20` hashes inside the program is given in the python script.

### Script:

The python script for brute forcing `4` bytes at a time for the flag:

```python
import string
import random
from hashlib import md5
l='!@_{}'
hashes=['9f9bd93c746d42c056754dd9607a7ff9','5b99e41b25e90adc18f7dcdf8dcb7298','95ae5f38b5e4ab0d9d11df14f11046cf','f0f7af88ab3aea458526510b1877ab62','676d5fb511b9b670b7c9b12c69771f6d',

c=0
flag=''
while(1):
	check=''.join(random.choice(string.letters+ string.digits+l) for _ in range(4))
	if(md5(md5(check).hexdigest()).hexdigest()==hashes[c]):
		flag+=check
		print flag
		c+=1
	if(c==20):
		break

```
